## puregym-scraper
This script logs into the PureGym website and records the number of users in
your local gym to a file, at an interval of your choice. For example, setting
the interval to 15 minutes will record data at 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes
past each hour.

A short script to plot the data is also included.
